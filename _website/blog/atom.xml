    <title>A few random opportunities in AI for Social Good</title>
    <updated>2023-10-02T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;p class="ablog-post-excerpt"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently a few friends have reached out asking if I knew of any opportunities to work on AI-related things that also have some kind of pro-social tie-in.
I think a lof people see AI as a technology with a lot of potential, but in an environment of companies that don’t seem to prioritize the benefit of human-kind over the never-ending hype machine and the promise of hyperscale growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;script type="text/x-thebe-config"&gt;
    {
        requestKernel: true,
        binderOptions: {
            repo: "Kisleif/mtbook",
            ref: "main",
        },
        codeMirrorConfig: {
            theme: "abcdef",
            mode: "python"
        },
        kernelOptions: {
            name: "python3",
            path: "./."
        },
        predefinedOutput: true
    }
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;kernelName = 'python3'&lt;/script&gt;</content>
